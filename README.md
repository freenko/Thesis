# Thesis

It is recommended to use Kaggle to run the following notebooks, especially the LSTM, due to the high amount of computations needed by the model
you can upload the dataset on the website here --> [ DATASET ](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stephengoldie/big-databiopharmaceutical-manufacturing).
I also would recommend use on the GPUs accelarator for the LSTM to speed up the training process.
